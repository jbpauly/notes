### Things to Note
1. All content, data, and notebooks came from the tutorial and credit goes to Alieen Nielsen
2. I strongly recommend you want this video if you are looking for a refresher on or are new to time series analysis, but also suggest you look at other material.
    a. What it covers
        - ARIMA (VERY brief)
        - State Space Models
        - Machine Learning 
        - Deep Learning (VERY brief)
    b. What it doesn't cover
        - in depth detail on statistical analysis like AR, MA, ARMA
        - in depth detail on deep learning
        - in depth detail on auto forecasting like PROPHET
3. If you follow along with the video and notebooks, you'll run into package conflicts
    a. Either navigate them yourself
    b. Use the requirements I have listed
        - Messy and out of date but it works with the notebooks
