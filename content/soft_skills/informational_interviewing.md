## Basics
### What is it? 
Meeting with an acquaintance to expand your network and learn. The goal is not to get or ask for a job.
### Why? 
- They are much easier to get than a job interview. You’re just asking for 15-60 minutes, not a job or contact with the
 hiring manager. 
- You know 300 people, who also know 300 people. Done right, you have 90,000 people in your network. The right position and hiring manager is out there waiting for you.

## Steps to Follow

### Step 1: Be genuinely interested in your meeting partner and let the interest in the person shape the content of the meeting
- Meet with people you genuinely want to meet with
- Don’t use someone or a meeting as a means to an end or bridge to meet with someone else
- Ask questions with answers you’d genuinely would like to know and make sense given who you’re interviewing

### Step 2: Plan the meeting well
- Starts with the approach
    - A mutual connection introduction
    - Cold outreach
    
### Step 3: Manage all aspects of communication like a winner
- Schedule the meeting appropriately
    - Reasonable time of day and time slot
- Set an agenda
- Conduct yourself in the meeting
- Questions should be quality open-ended questions you care about 
- Be memorable
    - Best way to be memorable is to be uniquely interested in the business and who you’re interviewing 
- Close out the meeting
    - Ask: 
        > Based on our conversation today is there anyone else you recommend I meet?
        - **'Yes'**, ask for the introduction
        - **'I’m not sure / let me think about it'**, then ‘If someone comes to mind I would really appreciate the
         connection’
        - **'No'**, then meeting didn’t go as well as you thought

### Step 4: Follow up appropriately
- Be considerate, excellent, and prompt
- Send a good email sent the same day or early the following morning
    - Short and punchy
    - Recap 1-2 things that stood out to you
    - Try and signal that you get the culture
- If partner gave a book, podcast, or article recommendation, consume it and share what you learned
- Hand written letter is good but no substitute for the email

## Pitfalls to avoid:
- Asking questions not well suited for the conversation partner
    - Shows sloppiness and not caring
- Not following up after the meeting
    - Greatly reduces value of meeting
    - Conversation partner may feel negatively about the interview
- Being shy about the meeting
    - Take responsibility for the meeting and lead it
    - show genuine interest and attention to detail
